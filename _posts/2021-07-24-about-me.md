When I started to create this blog at 2021-07-24, I was:

- a 28th-year-old dad with a newborn baby, I love her and her mom so much.
- a Data Scientist at Teko(VNPAY, DigiLife whatever...) for more than 1 year.
- in COVID pandemic's 2nd year and thought about human's future.

Any one can see my github, linkedin at footer.
